# Digital-Performance-Management

## Case Study from QTM 385: Data Analytics (EMORY UNIVERSITY)

You work for a marketing consultancy in the advanced analytics group. The group recently won the business of Nordstrom, an upscale department store. Nordstrom has, in recent years, focused increasingly on their online business. They see digital and e-commerce as core to their strategy going forward; however, they have no idea if their media spend in these new digital channels is cost-effective. Your charge is to put in place some basic digital performance management infrastructure that will help them to better understand how to best allocate their media spend.
